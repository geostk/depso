DEPSO
========

DEPSO, or called DEPS, is an algorithm hybridizing the advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). It solves (constrained) numerical optimization problem (NOP) as

where f(x) is the objective function and each g(x) is a constraint function to be satisfied, and _c_ and _d_ are constants. All the functions can be nonlinear and nonsmooth.
